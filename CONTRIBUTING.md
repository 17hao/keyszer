## Contributing

Hello. 👋 First off, thanks for taking the time to consider contributing. 💙 Keyszer is a volunteer effort.  We'd love if you decided to pitch in and [join our team](https://github.com/joshgoebel/keyszer/graphs/contributors)! 🎉


#### **Did you find a bug or unexpected behavior?** 🐞

* **Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a serious security vulnerability**, instead refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/joshgoebel/keyszer/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
* _Please ensure the bug was not already reported_ by searching on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/joshgoebel/keyszer/issues).
* If you're unable to find an existing issue, [open a new one](https://github.com/joshgoebel/keyszer/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, along with **verbose log output** and clear **steps to reproduce the problem**.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?** 🔧

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Do you want to contribute but have no idea where or how to start?** 🤔

* You may want to checkout any issues tagged [good first issue](https://github.com/joshgoebel/keyszer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and [help welcome](https://github.com/joshgoebel/keyszer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+welcome%22).


#### **Do you have a great idea for a change or entirely new feature?** 💡

* Suggest your proposed feature or change and it's benefits by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/joshgoebel/keyszer/issues/new).
* Participate in the discussion and listen to feedback to learn if your change is in-scope and would be accepted before putting lots of time and effort into writing the code.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**  🦋

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the project will generally not be accepted.


#### **Do you have questions about the code?** 💻

* Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/joshgoebel/keyszer/issues/new) with your question, or better yet, [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/nX6qSC8mer).


Thanks so very much! :heart: 💙 :heart:

Josh Goebel
